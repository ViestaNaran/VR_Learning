# VR_Learning
Copy of our VR_Learning project

The Code is in VR_Learning -> assests -> Brilleaberne -> scripts

There are pictures in VR_Learning -> pics

This link is a brief video, showing a testrun of the project we created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrFtwS6dvfo&t=1s

This project was initiated by Prajakt Pande a researcher at RUC who wanted to create a program to investigate virtual reality's qualities as an educational technology. The task was to create an interactive prototype that could be used to simulate "abstract concepts", by which he meant anything related to the natural sciences. 

The group consisted of Myself, Benjamin Westermann and Lasse Bjerg.

My role in this project was as a creative lead and developer. 

Benjamin and I developed the code while Lasse did an outstanding job on the research department, as we had to conclude this project with a written document to be defended as part of our final exam.

The project had to give multiple simulations of the same concept, and the simulations should have an effect on each other, thus illustrating multiple ways of representing the concept, to further the users understanding and learning. Our prototype made it possible for the user to build molecules and show them via a table, then using that table, they could add molecules to the ones they had already build.
